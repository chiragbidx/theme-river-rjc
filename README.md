# 🐼 Panda – Next.js + PostgreSQL SaaS Starter
## Enterprise AI-Safe Full-Stack Template

This repository is an **enterprise-grade, full-stack SaaS starter** built with **Next.js (App Router)**, **PostgreSQL**, and **Prisma**.

It is explicitly designed for:

- **AI-assisted development**
- **Long-lived production systems**
- **Strict data & authentication safety**
- **Predictable, reviewable diffs**
- **Enterprise-scale collaboration**

This file is the **single authoritative operating manual** for:

- Human developers
- AI coding agents
- Automated fixing systems
- Code review & CI tooling

If anything conflicts:

1. Panda Template Manifest rules win
2. This README wins over inline comments
3. Explicit user instructions win over defaults
4. Assumptions are forbidden

If unclear → **STOP AND ASK**

## 🧭 LANDING PAGES & DASHBOARD RULES (CRITICAL)

### Landing Pages

- **All landing page creation and updates MUST be done in:**

```
app/(dashboard)/page.tsx
```

- This file is the **single source of truth** for Panda’s SaaS landing experience
- No additional landing pages may be created unless explicitly requested
- Marketing and SaaS entry logic must converge here

---

### Dashboard & SaaS Feature Placement

All **SaaS-related features** must live inside:

```
app/(dashboard)/
```

Rules:

- New SaaS features must be added as **folders**
  (e.g. `/activity`, `/general`)
- `app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` must be updated to surface new features
- `app/(dashboard)/layout.tsx` may be updated **only** to support layout or navigation
- No SaaS UI, logic, or workflows may exist outside `(dashboard)`

---

### Authentication Pages (STRICT)

- **Auth pages must not be changed** unless explicitly requested by the user
- Existing auth structure must be preserved
- No visual, layout, or logic changes by default

Authentication is **stable infrastructure**, not a customization surface.

---

## 🔐 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES (CONTRACT)

Rules:

- `env.example` is the **single source of truth**
- AI must not invent new environment variables
- All env usage must be validated
- Secrets must never be committed
- UI code must never access env variables directly

---

## 🗄️ DATABASE & PRISMA (CRITICAL ZONE)

- PostgreSQL hosted on Railway
- Prisma ORM is mandatory
- `schema.prisma` is read-only by default
- `prisma/migrations` must never be edited
- UI and templates must never imply schema changes

If a UI requirement suggests a schema change → **STOP AND ESCALATE**

---

## 🔌 API ROUTES & SERVER ACTIONS

Rules:

- Request/response contracts are immutable
- Authentication checks must remain enforced
- Input validation is required (Zod preferred)

AI MAY:
- Refactor logic
- Improve error handling
- Optimize internals

AI MUST NOT:
- Change route signatures
- Break response shapes
- Remove auth
- Introduce side effects

---

## 🔐 AUTHENTICATION & AUTHORIZATION

- Providers are read-only by default
- Session shape is immutable
- Role logic must remain consistent

Forbidden:
- Privilege escalation
- Admin bypasses
- Role inference

---

## 🤖 SCRIPTS DIRECTORY CONTRACT

Scripts are **infrastructure-only**.

**Immutability Rule**

All files inside the `scripts/` directory are **effectively immutable**.  
They must not be modified, extended, or repurposed unless **explicitly approved**.

Scripts must never:
- Contain business logic
- Change schema behavior
- Affect runtime app logic
- Be imported by UI or API code

---

## 🐳 DOCKER CONTRACT

- Base image changes require approval
- Ports must remain consistent
- No secrets baked into images
- No background workers
- No sidecar services

---

## 🧭 ADDITIONAL OPERATIONAL RULES

### Single-Owner File Rule

Each file has **one primary responsibility**.  
Changes must stay within the owning file unless explicitly requested.

---

### No Drive-By Changes

Do not refactor, rename, reformat, or “clean up” unrelated code.  
If it wasn’t requested, it must not be touched.

---

### File Creation Rule

New files or folders may only be created when existing structure cannot support the change.  
Intent must be explicit and documented.

---

### Dashboard Primacy Rule

`(dashboard)` is the product.  
Everything outside it exists to support it.

---

### User Intent Override

When user instructions conflict with existing structure:

- User intent wins
- Violations must be explicitly called out before execution

---

### Visual vs Behavioral Separation

Visual changes must not alter:

- Data flow
- Auth logic
- API behavior
- State ownership

If they do → **STOP AND ASK**

---

### Safe Default Rule

When multiple solutions are possible, choose the:

- Least invasive
- Most explicit
- Most reversible

---

### Cookie Configuration Rules



Iframe Auth Fix

Ensured every auth cookie (setSession + middleware refresh/cleanup) now sends SameSite: 'none' (still httpOnly, secure, path: '/'), so the browser treats it as first-party even when the Next.js app lives inside a Bubble iframe.
Left all redirects and guards untouched; the middleware still deletes/refreshes tokens exactly as before—only the cookie metadata changed to allow iframe contexts to send the cookie.
If you hit this again in another repo

Confirm the iframe host and Next.js app share the same root domain (or plan for a parent-proxy domain) so cookies are first-party.
Check every place you set auth cookies (session helpers, server actions, middleware, etc.) and explicitly set sameSite: 'none', secure: true, and path: '/' so they aren’t blocked inside iframes.
Don’t tamper with redirect logic—keep if (!user) redirect(...) as-is—and avoid introducing client-side cookie hacks. Only the cookie metadata needs adjusting, not the auth flow.

---

### Uncertainty Rule

If requirements are ambiguous or incomplete → **STOP** and ask for clarification.
